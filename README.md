# Random-Recipe-Generator
# Inspiration
I reached a point where I was sick and tired of cooking the same meals for myself while trying to keep it healthy and under a certain calorie limit. 
# What the web app does and how it helps
The web app uses the Edamam API in order to generate a random recipe under a calorie limit and also with the main ingredient, both inputted by the user. This allows people to cook different meals, that are healthy and under their desired calorie range, while using ingredients that they desire
# How I built it?
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express
# Features I plan on adding
In the future I plan on adding the ability to create accounts, allowing the user to share recipes or rate the recipe generated so others can see the ratings as well
# How can you try it out?
After cloning the repository you're going to want to install a dependency and run: "npm install express" to be able to properly run the web app.
